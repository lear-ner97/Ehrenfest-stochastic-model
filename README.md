# Ehrenfest-stochastic-model

Through this project we could explore the fascinating applications of Ehrenfest model. This simple model is modeled using Markov chains and through theory and simulation we could demonstrate two mains applications: 1- second law of thermodynamics 2-approximation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
